### The 1st Apache Open-Source Top-Level Project (TLP) integrating Relational Database and Graph technologies.\

[Apache Org](https://age.apache.org/)
[Graph Database](https://github.com/apache/age)
[Graph Data Viewer](https://github.com/apache/age-viewer)

• Apache AGE is a PostgreSQL extension that adds graph query functionality to PostgreSQL.
• Through using Graph technologies such as the openCypher query specification and Graph-based data analysis
algorithms, users can access, store, query and analyze graph data stored in relational database such as
PostgreSQL.
Since 2020, Bitnine Global has been the major contributor of the Apache AGE project since Bitnine donated
AGE to the Apache Software Foundation, the world's largest open source foundation.
Established in 1999, The Apache Software Foundation is the world's largest open source foundation, stewarding
227M+ lines of code and providing more than $22B+ worth of software to the public.

For 6 months, the interns will be given a chance to gain a deeper understanding on how database system works,
Graph data, queries and algorithms, and practical experience with developing graph database management system
software and/or its viewer.
